             <p>Stamford is an extraordinary place that seems to have reached the 18th century and simply decided to stop there; a genteel and elegant snapshot of the past, conserved for the present and future. But behind this impressive façade lies struggle and strife; indeed, had Stamford not been so impoverished for so much of its existence, or been allowed to develop more by those who held power and money there, it’s likely that the character and architecture so prized today might have disappeared long ago. As a person in modern times, be thankful that it didn’t. But also be thankful that you didn’t have to live through some of the centuries that turned it into such an architectural jewel.

                The origins of Stamford are lost in legend – literally. In Geoffery of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Britanniae, a 12th century account of the Kings of Britain, a Bladud is mentioned. Rather less famous than the son he sired – Shakespeare’s King Lear – he supposedly reigned for 20 years from BC863. Bladud returned from Athens to rule the fledgling kingdom and decided to establish a university based on Greek principles.</p>

             <p>The Romans built Ermine Street across what is now Burghley Park and forded the River Welland to the west of Stamford, eventually reaching Lincoln. They also built a town to the north at Great Casterton on the River Gwash. In 61 CE Boudica followed the Roman legion Legio IX Hispana across the river. The Anglo-Saxons later chose Stamford as the main town, being on a larger river than the Gwash.

                The place-name Stamford is first attested in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, where it appears as Steanford in 922 and Stanford in 942. It appears as Stanford in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name means "stony ford".[7]
                
                In 972 King Edgar made Stamford a borough. The Anglo-Saxons and Danes faced each other across the river.[8] The town had grown as a Danish settlement at the lowest point that the Welland could be crossed by ford or bridge. Stamford was the only one of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw not to become a county town. Initially a pottery centre making Stamford Ware, it had gained fame by the Middle Ages for its production of the woollen cloth known as Stamford cloth or haberget, which "In Henry III's reign... was well known in Venice."[9]
                
                Stamford was a walled town,[8] but only a small portion of the walls remains. Stamford became an inland port on the Great North Road, the latter superseding Ermine Street in importance. Notable buildings in the town include the medieval Browne's Hospital, several churches and the buildings of Stamford School, a public school founded in 1532.[</p>
